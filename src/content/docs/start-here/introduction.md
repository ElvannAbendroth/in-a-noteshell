Hey, Welcome!

Get started with learning by selecting one of the topics.  This website is made so that it can either be read in order, but also each article is built so that you can jump to any part you're more interested in.

For now, the content of this website is focused on Four-Part Harmony, but other topics and sections might get added over time.  Here are some of the topics I'd be interested in covering on this website:

- Music Notation
- Basic Music Theory
- Counterpoint
- [Four-Part Harmony](/four-part-harmony/01-fundamentals/00-introduction)
- Composition & Songwriting
- Music Production
