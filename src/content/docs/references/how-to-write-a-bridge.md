title: How to Write a Bridge

*role of the bridge --> Bring a big contrast to the song*

chorus = catchy part, people will sing, epic

verse = driving, present

chorus and verse are both thought in a very melodic & harmonic way for me.  In the bridge we want to put focus on something else.

**My answer**  --> rhythms

## **Two bridge stereotypes**

### **Solution #1: Raising the energy**

- very syncopated rhythms and a
- very simple harmony
- more energy, augments the rhythm = short values
- repetitive melody --> 2-3 notes melody

### **Solution #2: Break down**

- diminish the rhythm = long values
- only use strings
- peaceful feel. Feels like everything suddenly stops, pause in time.
- Melody is simple (long values) but also lyrical.

Bridges can have vocals or not.

## **Simple Solution to a Bridge**

- 2 chords = V-I repeated (or I-IV)
- in minor you can replace V-I with VIIb-I
- max 3 notes on melody
- repetitive

## **Homework/Exercises**
