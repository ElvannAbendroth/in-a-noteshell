title: How to Choose Instruments
---



## Questions to ask yourself first

1. **What is your budget?**
    - How many instruments CAN you write for?
    - What is your final project going to look like? Will you record musicians or use samples?
2. **What range do you wish to cover?**
    - SOPRANO
    - ALTO
    - TENOR
    - BASS
3. **What roles do yo wish to cover?**
    - MELODIC
    - HARMONIC
    - RHYTHMIC

## Instrumentation Roles

Ideally, each instrument we chose should both have a specific role that they play, and cover for a specific voice range.  It's possible to write for a smaller amount of different voices, but the SOPRANO voice and the BASS should always minimally be there to have a sense of harmony going on.

Instruments can have more than one role, but more often than not, instruments have a roles they are most specifically designed to accomplish.

### Examples:

- The drums are best suited to the rhythmic role
- The flute is best suited to play melodies
- The electric bass is best suited for playing bass lines and support the harmony

Though, instruments like the piano, guitar and harp are also very well suited to both play a melodic & harmonic rule in music.  In very small ensembles or on a low budget, they are very well paired with a melodic instrument such as the voice.  That's why they are instruments of choice for songwriters.

### **Duo Example**

Voice & Piano

- The voice will play the MELODIC ROLE and will sing the SOPRANO range.
- The piano will cover for the HARMONY and will play the 3 other missing voices

### Trio Example

Flute, Guitar, Cello

- The flute will play the MELODIC role and play the SOPRANO voice
- The Guitar will have mainly an HARMONIC role in the ensemble and cover up for the inner missing harmony parts such as the ALTO and TENOR voice. As a second role, it can nicely add RHYTHMIC elements to the music.
- The Cello will play the HARMONIC role and the BASS voice.

### Quartet Example

2 violins, alto & cello

Violin I        MELODIC/SOPRANO

Violin II        HARMONIC/ALTO

Alto            HARMONIC/TENOR

Cello            HARMONIC/BASS

## Conclusion

So basically, with our instruments we try to cover as wide as a range as possible, and we try to AT LEAST cover the SOPRANO & BASS voices.   They constitute the very core elements of music creation.  The rhythms come right after, they add a very nice touch to any ensembles either it is added in the form of a guitar strumming pattern or a dedicated percussion section.
