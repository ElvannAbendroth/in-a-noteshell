Four-part harmony is a strict composition style that teaches the principles of harmony and voice-leading, and teaches the students how to harmonize melodies and make beautiful harmonies and lines in a western XIXth century compositional style.

The study of Four-part harmony is rigid, but will help the students drill down their skills in composition and harmony, as well as give them the fundamental skills to bridge the technical aspects of compositions and creativity.

### Pre-requisites

In this section, we'll learn about the fundamentals of 4-part harmony. In order to provide a full understanding of the musical context we'll be operating within, a big part of this section will be dedicated to reviewing some of the fundamentals of music theory, but within the context of 4-part harmony.

Before proceeding with the study of 4-part harmony, it is important to have a solid understanding of music theory fundamentals such as:

- Music notation
- Intervals
- Major & minor scales
- Triads (3-notes chords)
- 4-notes chords (Dominant)

Here are some resources to help you learn the basics of music theory:
