## Functions of Cadenzas

- Cadenzas are stereotypical musical formulas used as punctuation for musical phrasing.
	- Especially having V-I at the end of a phrase.
- At the cadenzas, we often observe changes to the musical texture:
	- Harmonic rhythms (either speeding up or slowing)
	- "The Rule of least effort" sometimes can be pushed aside.
	- More dense chords (such as 7ths, etc)

When writing homework, you'll want to identify them.

## Types of Cadenzas

1. **Conclusive**: Those that sound final
2. **Suspensive**: Those that don't
