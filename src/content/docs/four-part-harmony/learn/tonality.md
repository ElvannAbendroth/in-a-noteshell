Tonality is a **musical language** based on hierarchy and interested in the **functions** of each note of the scale, and centred around the tonic. There are 2 tonal scales: Major and minor.

While tonality refers to the relationship between pitches, "key" refers to the first pitch of the scale a piece is played in.

Just like English, tonality is a language. Scales correspond to letters of the alphabet and simply using letters in any given order isn't sufficient to call it "English". Tonality works the same way.

## Key Takeaways

- The concept of keys and tonality have dominated the music since at least 2 centuries.
- Tonality is **hierarchical system** in which each note of the scale has a function, and where there is one "main" note around which the system is organised: the **tonic**
- Tonality is not just about the notes themselves, but it's about their **function**.
- There are 2 tonal scales: **Major and minor**
