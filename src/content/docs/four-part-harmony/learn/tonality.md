Tonality is a **musical language** based on hierarchy and interested in the **functions** of each note of the scale, and centred around the tonic. There are 2 tonal scales: Major and minor.

Just like English, tonality is a language. Scales correspond to letters of the alphabet and simply using letters in any given order isn't sufficient to call it "English". Tonality works the same way.

- The concept of keys and tonality have dominated the music since at least 2 centuries.
- Tonality is **hierarchical system** in which each note of the scale has a function, and where there is one "main" note around which the system is organised: the **tonic**
- Tonality is not just about the notes themselves, but it's about their **function**.
- There are 2 tonal scales: **Major and minor**

## Primary & Secondary Functions

- Functions are indicated by a roman number under the staff (under the bass voice)
- Certain chords have a stronger function as they provide more stability, and tend to reinforce the key.

| Primary | Secondary |
| ------- | --------- |
| I       | II        |
| IV      | III       |
| V       | VI        |
|         | VII       |

"Primary" functions tend to reinforce the key while "Secondary" functions tend to "dilute" tonality.

The VIIth degree most of the time will get interpreted (on paper and by our ears) as part of the dominant function (V).  VII will be analysed as-is only in specific circumstances (which we might learn about in harmonic marches, for instance), in which case it will be considered as a secondary function.

The IInd function has a special status, because it is often used to approach the dominant chord, but because it has a lesser "tonal strength", therefore it is still considered a Secondary function.

## The V-I Pairing

The basis of the tonal system lies on "Dominant - Tonique" pairing (V-I). There are 2 typical movements that are the most typical of this pairing:

1. Lead-tone resolving upward
2. Ascending fourth, or descending fifth

- Vth degree is the primary driving force of the tonal system, especially when extended (dominant 7th, altered 5th, 9th)
- The presence of the tonic function is not even necessary: V is sufficient, because the IV-V and II-V parings cannot be interpreted in any other key.

> The Queen of the game is V, while I is the king, and is a lot more passive.
