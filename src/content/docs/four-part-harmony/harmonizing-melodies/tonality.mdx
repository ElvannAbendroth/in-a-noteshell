Tonality is a **musical language** based on hierarchy and interested in the **functions** of each note of the scale,
and centered around the tonic. There are 2 tonal scales: Major and minor.

While tonality refers to the relationship between pitches, "key" refers to the first pitch of the scale a piece is played in.

#### Key Takeaways

- The concept of keys have dominated the music since at least 2 centuries.
- Tonality is **hierarchical system** in which each note of the scale has a function, and where there is one "main" note around which the system is organised: the **tonic**
- Tonality is not just about the notes themselves, but it's about their **function**.
- There are 2 tonal scales: **Major and minor**

<Card title="Tonality vs. English Language" icon="open-book">
  Tonality is a language, just like English, where scales correspond to letters. Because letters are available in
  english, doesn't mean that any arrangement of those letters are English.
