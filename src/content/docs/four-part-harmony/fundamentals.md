## Introduction

Four-part harmony is a strict composition style that teaches the principles of harmony and voice-leading, and teaches the students how to harmonize melodies and make beautiful harmonies and lines in a western XIXth century compositional style.

The study of 4-part harmony is rigid, but will help the students drill down their skills in composition and harmony, as well as give them the fundamental skills to bridge the technical aspects of compositions and creativity.

### Pre-requisites

In this section, we'll learn about the fundamentals of 4-part harmony. In order to provide a full understanding of the musical context we'll be operating within, a big part of this section will be dedicated to reviewing some of the fundamentals of music theory, but within the context of 4-part harmony.

Before proceeding with the study of 4-part harmony, it is important to have a solid understanding of music theory fundamentals such as:

- Music notation
- Intervals
- Major & minor scales
- Triads (3-notes chords)
- 4-notes chords (Dominant)

Here are some resources to help you learn the basics of music theory:

## Intervals

In 4-part harmony, we'll consider 2 aspects of intervals: their type (melodic or harmonic), and their quality (consonant or dissonant). They will require a different treatment according to their type and quality.

### Interval Types

There are two types of intervals:

1. **Melodic**: Intervals played consecutively (i.e. a melody)
2. **Harmonic**: Intervals played simultaneously (i.e. chords.)

In 4-part harmony, just like in species counterpoint, melodic and harmonic intervals will be treated differently and follow a slightly different set or rules.

When treating melodic intervals, we'll be more interested in the melodic direction and making sure the line is easy to sing. On the other hand, when treating harmonic intervals, we'll be interested in tonal fusion, chords, and voice-leading.

In 4-part harmony, we'll be focusing more on harmony than in species counterpoint. Nonetheless, we'll still want to consider the melodic aspect.

### Interval Quality

#### Consonances

- There are two types of consonant intervals: **perfect** & **imperfect**.
- Perfect consonances tend to sound '**empty**', so we'll try to hide them.
- Imperfect intervals sound more '**rich**'.

| **Perfect Consonances** | **Imperfect Consonances** |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Perfect Octaves (P8)    | Major Thirds (M3)         |
| Perfect Unisons (P1)   | Minor Thirds (m3)         |
| Perfect Fourths (P4)    | Major Sixths (M6)         |
| Perfect Fifths (P5)     | Minor Sixths (m6)         |

The perfect fourth is generally considered like a consonance, except when forming an interval with the bass line, in which case it will be considered dissonant. (see more with second inversions)

#### Dissonances

Other intervals are considered dissonant, some of which are considered "soft" and some of which are considered "hard"

| **Soft Dissonances** | **Hard Dissonances** |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Major Seconds (M2)   | Minor Seconds (m2)   |
| Perfect Fourth (P4)  | Major Sevenths (M7)  |
| Minor Sevenths (m7)  | Minor Ninths (m9)    |
| Major Ninth (M9)     |                      |

Other augmented and diminished intervals are considered "soft"

The triton (d5 or A4) is generally considered like a soft dissonance in the context of tonality, although in some other musical contexts, it could be considered a consonance. In 4-part harmony, we'll be treating it like a dissonance.

### Enharmonic Intervals

Enharmonic intervals are intervals which sound identical, but are spelled differently. Even though they sound the same, they don't occupy the same musical function.

A note with a sharp will tend to resolve upward, while a note with a flat tends to resolve downward.

One of the most important intervals we'll come across is the augmented second (present in the minor harmonic scale), which sounds identical to a minor third, but which appears in specific contexts.

## Major Scale

In 4-part harmony, we're interested in **functions** rather than in the **notes** of the scales.  This means we're interested not only in the note themselves, but in the chords they form together.

The system we're using to refer to those chords is called "functional harmony".  We're using roman number (I, II, II, IV, V, VI, VII) where "I" corresponds to the triad built on top of the tonic (first note of the scale)

### Constitutive Chords

If we build a triad on top of each degree of the **Major scale**, we get this

| I   | II  | III | IV  | V   | VI  | VII |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maj | min | min | Maj | Maj | min | dim |

Where:

- I, IV and V are **Major**
- II, III and IV are **minor**
- VII is diminished

Because of its dissonant nature, VII is rarely used, and will often times be interpreted as V instead.

> ❤️ **Note:** I strongly recommend learning the constitutive chords by heart, it will solve some headache in the future.  One way I recommend doing so is to associate them with the white keys on the piano for future reference.

## Tessitura

Since 4-part harmony is a "strict" compositional style, the writing of all exercises should be arranged using the classical four choir voices.  from highest to lowest, here are the names of the voices:

- Soprano
- Alto
- Tenor
- Bass

### Tessitura (Vocal Ranges)

Here's a reference guide for the minimum and maximum vocal range for each voice:

![Vocal range of the 4 choir voices](@assets/tessiture-des-quatre-voix-de-choeur.png)

### Staves & Stems

Four-part harmony exercises should be written on the **grand staff,** where the Soprano and Alto are written on the **Treble Clef,** while the Tenor and Bass are on the **Bass Clef**.

When needed, the Soprano and Tenor's stems will be pointing up, while the Alto and Bass should be pointing down.

## Types of Motions

### Harmonic Motions

In 4-part harmony as well a species counterpoint, we observe 4 different possible types of movements between voices:

1. **Contrary**: When two voices move in opposite directions
2. **Oblique**: when one of the voices remains on the same note, while the other moves in either direction.
3. **Direct**: When two voices move in the same direction, but not by the same distance.
4. **Parallel**: When two voices move in the same direction by the same distance.

### Melodic Motions

There are 2 types of melodic motions:

1. **Steps**
2. **Leaps**

In general, we'll favour step-wise motions over leaps, but to keep a line interesting we'll also want to include occasional leaps.  Most problems we'll be encountering can be solved by using step-wise motions, but a melody can quickly become boring and predictable without a bit of variation.

The study of melody is mostly reserved to counterpoint, but we'll still want to pay some amount of attention to creating beautiful melodies for our exercises.  The most important voice to pay attention to will be the **soprano**, while the inner voices are not as important melodically.
