Intervals are the relative distance between 2 notes. There are 2 categories of intervals: consonances and dissonances.

## Consonant Intervals

- There are two types of consonances: perfect & imperfect.
- There are 2 types of consonant intervals: perfect and imperfect
- Perfect consonances tend to sound 'empty', so we'll try to hide them.
- Imperfect intervals sound more rich.

**Perfect Consonant Intervals:**

- Perfect Octaves (P8)
- Perfect Unissons (P1)
- Perfect Fourths (P4)
- Perfect Fifths (P5)

**Imperfect Consonant Intervals:**

- Major Thirds (M3)
- Minor Thirds (m3)
- Major Sixths (M6)
- Minor Sixths (m6)

## Dissonant Intervals

Other intervals are considered dissonant, some of which are considered "soft" and some of which are considered "hard"

**Soft Dissonances:**

- Major Seconds (M2)
- Perfect Fourth (P4)
- Minor Sevenths (m7)
- Major Ninth (M9)
- Augmented Intervals
- Diminished Intervals

**Hard Dissonances:**

- Minor Seconds (m2)
- Major Sevenths (M7)
- Minor Ninths (m9)

## Special Intervals

### Tritons

The triton is considered like a soft dissonance in context, although in some other musical contexts, it could be considered a consonance. We'll be treating it like a dissonance.

### Perfect Fourths

The perfect fourth is generally considered like a consonance, except when forming an interval with the bass line, uin which case it will be considered dissonant. (see more with second inversions)

## Melodic & Harmonic Intervals

Melodic and harmonic intervals are not treated the same way in four-part harmony.

Melodic intervals are played melodically, which means they are played one after another, as opposed to harmonic intervals, which are played simultaneously.

## Enharmonic Intervals

Enharmonic intervals are intervals which sound identical, but are spelled differently. Even though they sound the same, they don't occupy the same musical function.

A note with a sharp will tend to resolve upward, while a note with a flat tends to resolve downward.

One of the most important intervals we'll come accross is the augmented second (present in the minor harmonic scale), which sounds identical to a minor third, but which appears in specific contexts.
